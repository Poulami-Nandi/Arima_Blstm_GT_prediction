# Methodology

This project integrates ARIMA and Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) models to forecast Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock prices using historical OHLC data and Google Trends interest data.

- **ARIMA** is used for linear trend forecasting.
- **BLSTM** handles complex nonlinear patterns and time dependencies.
- Data includes sentiment proxies from Google Trends to enrich input signals.

Combined predictions aim to balance interpretability (ARIMA) and accuracy (BLSTM).
